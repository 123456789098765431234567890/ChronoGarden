# **App Name**: ChronoGarden: Temporal Harvest

## Core Features:

- Era Unlocking: Unlock new eras (Prehistoric, Medieval, Modern, Future) by accumulating 'chrono-energy'. Each era brings unique crops, resources, and farming challenges.
- Resource Management: Manage and balance era-specific resources. Optimize growing conditions with tech, natural methods, and resource automation.
- Automation System UI: Design and implement a UI for a drag-and-drop automation system that players can use to automate planting, harvesting, and resource management in each era.
- Era-Specific Cultivation: Cultivate plants unique to each era with era-specific mechanics: prehistoric giant ferns fertilized with 'dino-fertilizer'; medieval alchemy-based soil enchantments; drones and automated harvesters; climate domes
- AI Crop Optimization: Employ AI crop engineers that analyzes in-game crop health and suggests optimal configurations. The tool decides when the suggestion is appropriate, based on game conditions.
- Prestige/Rebirth System: Reboot the garden while retaining rare seeds, which can then grow in any era to get a head start.
- Mini-Ecosystem Balance: Balance automation efficiency with environmental considerations. Automation might reduce the soil quality, which the player would have to address.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A lush, saturated green (#71BC78), evoking growth and nature but with a hint of modern vibrancy. Plants grow over time, which suggests this color choice.
- Background color: A very light, desaturated green (#F0F4F0), provides a calm backdrop that doesn't distract from the colorful elements of the garden and time eras.
- Accent color: A muted yellow-green (#AEB851), this color will call attention to special resources or elements of the user interface.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', a modern serif which adds an elegant, fashionable, high-end feel
- Body font: 'PT Sans' sans-serif which pairs with 'Playfair' to bring warmth to long blocks of text.
- Icons: Use clean, geometric icons with a slight retro-futuristic feel to represent each era, crop type, and automation system.
- Design the layout with distinct zones for garden view, resource management, era selection, and the automation interface.
- Implement smooth, subtle animations to showcase the growth of plants, the flow of resources, and the transition between different time eras.
